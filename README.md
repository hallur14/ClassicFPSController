# ClassicFPSController

I created this FPSController with older games like Quake and Half Life in mind.
It handles slopes pretty well and has pretty well and has Quake 3 style sidestrafing.

The project includes assets and a small level to run around in.

It uses Unity's old input system.

Feel free to use and modify in your own project.
