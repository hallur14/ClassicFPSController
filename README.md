# ClassicFPSController

I created this FPSController with older games like Quake and Half Life in mind.  
I'm happy with how it handles momentum and slopes.  
It also has Quake3 style sidestrafing.

The project includes a small level to run around in.

It uses Unity's old input system.

Feel free to use and modify in your own project.
